## Prompting Questions for Assessing NLS Usage Security

- **Inadvertent Exposure:**  Does the app unintentionally expose notification content by transmitting or storing it insecurely, thereby creating potential attack vectors? Consider:
  - Is the notification content transmitted or stored in plaintext rather than encrypted?
  - Are insecure methods used on notification content, such as storing on the device's external storage or transmitting via insecure protocols like HTTP?
  - Note: Inadvertent Exposure should only be considered when both conditions are met simultaneously.
- **Deliberate Harvesting:** Does the app misuse NLS to intentionally collect sensitive information from notifications? Evaluate:
  - Does the app's use of NLS align with its stated or reasonably expected functionalities?
  - Are there filtering processes that specifically target sensitive content (e.g., SMS credentials) or notifications from apps likely to contain sensitive information (e.g., messaging, banking, or email apps)?
  - Note: The presence or absence of sensitive filtering alone is not definitive evidence of deliberate harvesting. Apps may collect all notification content without filtering for malicious purposes, while sensitive filtering could also be used for legitimate functions (e.g., social media message auto-reply apps). Prioritize assessing whether the app's overall intention in using NLS appears benign or malicious.
- **Unwarranted Notification Cancellation:** Does the app exhibit unjustified notification dismissal behaviors? Consider:
  - Is there evidence of the app dismissing notifications to conceal its own malicious activities or other suspicious behavior?
  - Does the app remove notifications from competitor apps in a way that could be considered unfair competition?
  - Note: Unwarranted Notification Cancellation is constituted if one of the conditions met.
- **Notification Interaction with Unsolicited Crafted Content:** Does the app unsafely trigger notification actions (such as replying to social media messages directly via notifications) with unsolicited crafted content? Consider:
  - When interacting with the notification, does the app inject malicious content, such as links to promote scams or malware, or other unsolicited content like advertising or promotional messages?



## Chain-of-thought Reasoning Example

- **Step 1: Expected Behavior Analysis. **From the App Description "Control phone volume for notifications," we infer that the app likely uses the NLS to to intercept notifications and adjust phone volume based on notification content. Its focus is on notification volume control rather than notification content management.
- **Step 2: Actual Behavior Determination.** The Characterization Result reveals that the app potentially writes notification content, including text, to local files. Further analysis of the taint propagation chain and source code confirms that the app utilizes FileWriter to store all notification information in external storage. This is evidenced by the use of getExternalStorageDirectory() method. Consequently, this storage practice constitutes Inadvertent Exposure, as the app unintentionally exposes notification content by storing it in an insecure location accessible to other apps.
- **Step 3: Behavior Comparison.** Upon comparing expected and actual behaviors, we find that the collection of all notifications primarily serves to implement the app's declared functionality, such as customizing ringtones. There is no evidence suggesting that the app specifically targets sensitive notification content for collection. Consequently, the app's behavior does not constitute Deliberate Harvesting of sensitive information.
- **Step 4: Additional Behavioral Analysis.** The Characterization Result indicates that the app does not engage in notification dismissal or notification interaction. This confirms the absence of Unwarranted Notification Cancellation or Notification Interaction with Unsolicited Crafted Content abuse.
